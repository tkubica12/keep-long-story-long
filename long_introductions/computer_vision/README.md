# Long Introduction to Computer Vision

## Basics
See notebooks going from naive attempts like LR and DNN into actually working models such as simple CNN and RestNet18.

## YOLO - How models learn, tranfer learning, various computer vision tasks
- How models learn?
- Comparing image classification, object detection, segmentation or posture detection
- Fine-tuning, transfer learning, feature extraction

## Using computer vision as a service in Azure
- Quick look
- Captioning and dense captioning
- Embeddings, image search and multimodal models
